# ebay-country-filter

A simple userscript that cleans up your ebay search results by hiding items from certain countries.

It's a work in progress.

This was made to be used with a userscript manager such as Greasemonkey or Tampermoney. You can install it through [Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/17986-ebay-country-filter).

Right now only Chrome 41+ (March '15) and FF 34+ (Dec '14) supported but older versions along with other popular browsers with decent userscript managers might be supported in the future one day.
