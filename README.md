# ebay-country-filter

A simple userscript that cleans up your ebay search results by hiding items from certain countries


This was made to be used with a userscript manager such as Greasemonkey or Tampermoney. You can install it through [Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/17986-ebay-country-filter).

Right now only Chrome 41+ (March '15) is supported but I'm trying to get this working in Firefox too. FF 34+ (Dec '14) support should be here soon. Still fixing some bugs. 

Older versions of Chrome and Firefox might be supported in the future, and possibly Opera, etc. any popular browser that has a good userscript manager.
